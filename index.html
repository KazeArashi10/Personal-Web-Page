    <h2>Top 7 FGC Rivalries</h2>
    <h3>Over the years, rivals have appeared in the games, whether it be Sonic and Shadow, Mario and Donkey Kong, or even the Top 10 Fighting Game Rivals which I'm about to mention. This will be based on story, playstyle, and their main gimmicks.</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Kazuya vs Heihachi Mishima from the Tekken series</li>
        <p>Heihachi married Kazumi Hachijo, and had a child named Kazuya, and was unaware that his wife, and by extent, his son, were demons cursed with the Devil Gene. Heihachi killed Kazumi and threw Kazuya off a cliff when he was 5. Many years later, Kazuya enters the first King of Iron Fist, with him beating Heihachi and throwing him off a cliff. Then Kazuya hosts the King of Iron Fist 2 with Heihachi entering and winning, not only seeing Devil Kazuya, but threw him off a volcano. Then he was resurrected in Tekkn 4, losing to Heihachi. Then in the intro to Tekken 5, Kazuya and Heihachi fought together until Kazuya betrayed him by leaving him to die in an explosion. They meet again in Tekken 7, with Kazuya finally killing and defeating Heihachi for good.</p>
        <p>Both characters fight the exact same, but play differently.</p>
        <p>The retcon about Kazuya making a deal with the Devil in Tekken 2, was then revealed in Tekken 4 introducing the Devil Gene, and in Tekken 7 when it introduced Kazumi.</p>
        <li>Sol vs Ky in the Guilty Gear series</li>
        <p>Sol and Ky were once part of the Holy Order of Knights, until Sol stole the Fireseal and Ky had to stop him, but he failed. They both meet again in the tournament with Ky, but got interrupted by Testament. Ky had interrupt Sol from killing Dizzy in Guilty Gear X. They meet in Guilty Gear XX, but with Sol beating Ky again with him questioning about Ky's justice. They both meet in Accent Core where Sol tells Ky to do whatever he want after the first fight, then they meet again if Sol didn't lose to anyone, with them ending going separate paths until Overture, where they are allies, same within Guilty Gears Xrd Sign-Rev2 and -Strive-</p>
        <p>Sol is much more of a powerhouse and hides his power unless he doesn't use Dragon Install. Ky is much more faster and agile than Sol.</p>
        <p>I see no probelm with this rivalry, but Sol and Ky telling each other to go all out.</p>
        <li>Ragna vs Jin from the BlazBlue series</li>
        <p>Both, along with their sister, Saya were raised in a church by a girl named Celica A. Mercury. A few years went by with Saya being sick, and Ragna had to pay more attention to her, instead of playing with Jin. Jin grew jealous and hated Saya and Ragna, Saya introduced the Nox Nyctores: Yukianesa to Jin. He used it to cut Ragna's right arm, take Saya, and killed Celica, along with the former member of the 6 Heroes, Yuuki Terumi. In Calamity Trigger, they both fought with their hardest with Ragna winning. Continuum Shift, Jin was crippled and couldn't use his weapon, so he lost to Ragna. Chronophantasma, Ragna was weakened and the "resurrected" Celica had to intervene. Central Fiction, freed from the influence of the Nox Nyctores, Jin tries to prevent Ragna from self-erasure, but failed.</p>
        <p>Both play extremely differently from each other, where as Ragna has the lowest and the highest HP in the game, thanks to his Drive, Jin uses his drive to freeze people, making combos a little bit longer, with fast moves.</p>
        <p>There are many problems with this one. First, whenever Jin talks to Ragna, the tone just changed from serious to "affectionate" because of the side effects of weilding a Nox. 2nd, Jin's power was extremely varied depending on that type of media. As in the BlazBlue Manga; Jin was weaker than Ragna, In the games; Ragna and Jin are tied in strength, and in another Calamity Trigger manga, Ragna had to use the Azure Grimoire to beat him.</p>
        <li>King vs Armor King from the Tekken series</li>
        <p>King and Armor King has been rivals ever since Tekken 1 and 2, and when King died by Ogre's hands and Armor King by Marduk's, Tekken 5-7, the first Armor King was a brother to the 2nd Armor King, and he trained the 2nd King, who was an orphan at the first King's Orphanage. The thing for King II is that he was friends with the man who killed Armor King II's brother. He now stands in the middle of the farce.</p>
        <p>Both of them are wrestlers with different moves.</p>
        <p>The only probelm with this is that the 2nd pair of Kings weren't enemies turned friendly rivals all because of Marduk being friends with the 2nd King.</p>
        <li>Gogeta vs Vegito from various Dragon Ball Games</li><p>Ever since the Kazenshuu in 1995, Toriyama has made fans in the later decades debate about which Fusion's stronger between Gogeta and Vegito which both are Goku/Kakarotto and Vegeta's fusion. The dance and the potara are kind of Yin and Yang, The Potara fusion has a longer time limit, if not worn by the Supreme Kais, but that time can be shortened by their power. The Fusion Dance lasts for half an hour, but canonically, there is no drain in the time limit with their power.</p>
        <p>I'm gonna use their gameplay from FighterZ, Super Saiyan Blue Gogeta is more rushdwon and tend to end it quick, Super Saiyan Blue Vegito is more pressure based, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta is more of a mix of both. All of them have high damage and it's scary when you put the 3 of them in a game together.</p>
        <p>The big flaw is that the matchup, despite all of the debates, shouldn't even exist if they're not from different timelines. Because there's only one Goku and Vegeta in the Dragon Ball series.</p>
        <li>Paul vs Kuma from the Tekken Series</li>
        <p>Paul has fought many foes from the Tekken series. Although none compares to rivalry he has with Kuma, who is a bear. Paul and Kuma I's score is 2-0, where with Kuma II is 2-1, because Paul has beat the first Kuma twice in Tekken's 1-2, where he beat Kuma II in Tekken's 3 and 5, the only reason he lost in Tekken 4 is because Paul was wallowing in despair that he didn't win the King of Iron Fist Tournament 3, Kuma has been training for 2 years after the King of Iron Fist 3.</p>
        <p>Paul's fighting style is MMA based on Judo, where Kuma is based on Mishima-Style Karate, where Paul has done with this before, because he fought Kazuya to a draw. Paul is more power-based, Kuma is more focused on Combos.</p>
        <p>Like Seth and Hyde, there really isn't much backstory, but it hardly needs any because they met in Tekken 1, and technically in Tekken 3 as Kuma I died of old age.</p>
        <li>Hyde Vs Seth from Under Night In-Birth</li>
    <p>Hyde and Seth are one of Arc System Work's famous rivalries in their FGC history. Hyde and Seth both go to the same school, although Seth's a freshman and Hyde's a sophomore, but there's so much more to the two of them. Seth's ancestors were rebels to a clan called the Night Blade. Hyde was bit by a Void that only appears in the Hollow Night, which made him awaken his EXS, Void Red, which allows him to summon one of the indulgence Weapons. Seth, however got his Indulgence Weapon from a client from Amnesia named Bloody Chaos. Seth, like many others, got his EXS from the Hollow Night. Both are aware of a girl named Linne. Linne helped Hyde from when he got bit, and helped him train to use his EXS properly.</p>
    <p>Hyde's playstyle is based on rushdown where he puts his training into use. Seth is agile and could let his opponents guard down with various mixups. Hyde is more power-based, where Seth uses his speed and agility to end this match with either syle or ending it quickly.</p>
    <p>They both have a vs. rival OST called Mutual Situation, which combines both Monochrome Memory (Seth) and Scraper Sky High (Hyde) together.</p>
    <p>The only flaw about this rivalry is that there really isn't much backstory between them, even though Hyde are practically everyone's main target.</p>
